# IqCar

From top directory run:

python iqcar/IQ_car.py main

and you should see a sequence of images as well as the board being solved from the terminal output!

Take a look into the /outputs folder if you want to take a look at what more of our sample images look like, but our demo is hardcoded to run on IMG_18.png which is fully functional.
