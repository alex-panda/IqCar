    # runHw4 is the "main" interface that lets you execute all the 
    # walkthroughs and challenges in this homework. It lists a set of 
    # functions corresponding to the problems that need to be solved.

    # Note that this file also serves as the specifications for the functions 
    # you are asked to implement. In some cases, your submissions will be 
    # auto-graded.  Thus, it is critical that you adhere to all the specified 
    # function signatures.
    #
    # Before your submission, make sure you can run runHw4('all') 
    # without any error.
    #
    # Usage:
    # python runHw4.py                  : list all the registered functions
    # python runHw4.py 'function_name'  : execute a specific test
    # python runHw4.py 'all'            : execute all the registered functions
